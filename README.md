## Weather app with JS

My first weather app that I made with JS. My goal in the project was to automatically offer results from a list stored in a JSON file in case of a search, and to store the favorites at the top of the existing drop-down list. This project is made with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JS</strong>.

### How to open the project:
- in VScode open the terminal
- open "ask-nasa-javascript-GaborSzaboHUN" folder if you somewhere else
- <code>npm install express</code> to install Express.JS
- <code>node backend/server.js</code> to start the server
- <code>http://127.0.0.1:9000</code> you can find the project on that IP address
